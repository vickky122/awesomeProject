fmt.Scan() has also limitation as we can't easily fetch multi-word input values.
Fetching text that consists of more than a single word is tricky with this function.

For the moment, we only need single words / digits as input, so that's no problem.


## Difference between float32 and float64
The fundamental difference between float32 (single-precision) and float64 (double-precision) lies in the amount of memory they use and, consequently, the precision and range of numbers they can represent.
float32 (Single-Precision):
Uses 32 bits (4 bytes) of memory.
Provides approximately 7-8 decimal digits of precision.
Has a smaller range, approximately ±3.4 × 10³⁸.
Generally faster for computations and uses less memory, making it suitable for applications where high precision is not critical, such as graphics processing, machine learning training, and large datasets with acceptable rounding.


float64 (Double-Precision):
Uses 64 bits (8 bytes) of memory.
Provides approximately 15-16 decimal digits of precision.
Offers a much larger range, approximately ±1.8 × 10³⁰⁸.
Provides greater accuracy but comes with the cost of increased memory usage and potentially slower computation times compared to float32. It is preferred for applications requiring high numerical accuracy, such as scientific computing, financial calculations, and simulations where precision is paramount.





we can change the data or mutate the data by using pointers as if without using the pointers if we try to change it then
it is only going to perform on the copied value and if we try to access it, then we will get the same value
as copied values have been changed, not the origional value.
So for changing the origional value we must mutate using the pointers so as to see the changes in the origional values
